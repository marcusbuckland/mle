    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "For this question I decided to explore the relationship between salaries and wages & inflation. I used CPI as my measure of inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to conducting any analysis, intuitively I suspected there would be a positive association between salaries and wages and CPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did some very quick googling just to ensure that my approach made sense- and found two documents which further shaped the direction of my analyis. These documents are included in this repository in the `Supporting Documents` directory.\n",

    "1. dp09-06-Analysing wage and price dynamics in NZ\n",
    "2. p20045coll4_54-Exploring Tradable and Non-Tradable Inflation in Consumer Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Abstract of the first document listed above it says:\n",
    "\n",
    "> _We find that there is a joint causality between wages and disaggregate inflation. An increase in wage inflation forecasts an increase in non-tradable inflation._\n",
    "\n",
    "I found on the Stats NZ website that they publish a tradable and non-tradable inflation series, and given the quote above it made sense to me to use this data for my analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to create two models of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Model 1:} \\ Y_1 = \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Model 2:} \\ Y_2 = \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Y_1$ is New Zealand's CPI for Tradeable groups in `model 1` and;\n",
    "\n",
    "$Y_2$ is New Zealand's CPI for Non-tradeable groups in `model 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "I thought that Simple Linear Regression was a sensible and appropriate choice, as it was of interest to me to interpret the $\\beta$ coefficients, to understand the association between salaries and wages and inflation in NZ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further information re CPI and how it is calculated can be found on the Stats NZ website- https://www.stats.govt.nz/topics/consumers-price-index"
